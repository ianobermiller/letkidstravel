We live in Washington state but grew up in Wisconsin. Consequently, all of our family and college friends are back there. We have always flown to see them a couple of times of year but now that Wellington is over two it is becoming quite expensive, especially in the summer months. We try to keep costs low on these shorter trips to save up for big vacations so we always try to find a really good airfare deal.

Well, with planning for Europe I had no time to research airline tickets. Instead, we will drive the 2,000 miles to the Dairy State. My husband has parental leave to use from when Isla was born, so we will be packing up the car and embarking on something we have never done, a road trip. We have never driven more three hours to a destination and doing this with two children is a daunting task. I actually find this more frightening than a four-week European vacation.

We are planning to make a few stops along the way to see Yellowstone and Mt. Rushmore but even with those breaks it will be a lot of straight driving! How to keep my strong willed daughter happy is a question I ponder daily. I keep hoping that a miracle will occur and she will become a content baby. Any ideas on ways to keep an eleven month old entertained?
