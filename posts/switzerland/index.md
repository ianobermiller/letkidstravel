## Zermatt

![Hiking around the Matterhorn](images/matterhorn.jpeg)

- Cogwheel train to Gornergrat, sit on right side of train, all tickets are 1-way priced, so don’t buy round trip
  - 07:00 08:00 08:24 08:48 09:12 09:36 10:00
  - See the black nosed sheep, ask
- Hike the scenic loop 0.4 mi
- For panoramic views of the area, continue up the trail behind the hotel. From here, you can see the Gorner Glacier, the second largest glacier in the Alps. You can also see the Monte Rossa Massif and Switzerland’s highest peak, Dufourspitze.
- Hike to Riffelsee for great views:
  - You begin your hike at the Gornergrat mountain station.  First of all, make the most of the viewing platform to look at and enjoy the many peaks you can see from there.  By using the free telescopes you can discover the names and heights of the various summits.  Then you make your way along the Hohtälli ridge where the steep descent towards the Gorner Glacier will take some concentration. 
  - Then you come to the Monte Rosa hut approach; you don’t go towards the hut but take the way with the view of the Matterhorn ahead of you. A new and very special perspective of the Matterhorn is waiting for you!  Now the path is gentle, going up and down, towards the Riffelsee lake.  We recommend a stop there to take some photos or have a picnic.  Finally, you have a choice of routes that will take you down to the Riffelberg  station. 
- Swiss Topwalk trail (#23) to Riffelberg, or short walk to Rotenboden and take the train back to Zermatt
  - There is a small lake after Rifelsee with a large rock on the other side for a great picture
- From Riffelberg, take the Gornergrat Railway back to Zermatt (CHF 40) or ride the Riffelberg Express to Zermatt (CHF 39.50). The Riffelberg Express is a cable car that runs from Riffelberg to Furi. Once in Furi, change cable cars to continue to Zermatt (included in the CHF 39.50).

### Day 2
